# CI Workshop Demo: Automated Testing Workflow

This repository is designed to demonstrate how **Continuous Integration (CI)** works in practice using **GitHub Actions** and Python.

The core purpose of this exercise is to observe the automated feedback loop: **RED Check (Failure)** and **GREEN Check (Success)**.

## 💻 Prerequisites (Run Locally)

To run the local tests and push the code, you must have Python and the necessary testing tools installed.

### 1. Install Python

Ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your system (version 3.8 or newer is recommended).

### 2. Install Dependencies

You will need the `pytest` framework to execute the unit tests and `flake8` for code style checks.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# This command installs the necessary Python packages globally
pip install pytest flake8
