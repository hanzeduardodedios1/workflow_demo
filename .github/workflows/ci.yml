# 2. JOBS: A workflow is made up of one or more jobs.

    # The steps define the tasks executed in sequence
    steps:
    # Step 1: Check out the repository code

    # Step 4: Run the Linter (Quality Gate)
    - name: Run Linting Checks (flake8)
      # This checks code style and potential syntax issues.
      run: |
